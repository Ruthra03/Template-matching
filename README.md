  The block is moved over the larger image pixel by pixel or in larger strides. The similarity measure is computed at each position of the block. The position with the highest similarity indicates the best match. The similarity is measured using any one of the following methods:
  
  i) Square difference matching
  ii) Correlation matching
  iii) Correlation coefficient matching
  iv) Normalized methods
